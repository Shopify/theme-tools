        <area>**Improve the conciseness and efficiency of Liquid code** while maintaining the same functionality</area>
        <area>**Leverage the most appropriate Liquid** features (filters, tags, and objects); sometimes a filter can achieve the same result as a block of code</area>
        <area>Avoid logic that matches the default behavior (especially for filters)</area>
        <area>Improve readability, but **be pragmatic** and **do not suggest unless there's a strong reason**</area>
        <area>Use filters for operations that perform the same function as a filter</area>
        <area>Use unless for negative conditions</area>

        <point>**Suggest only valid Liquid**</point>
        <point>Suggested code must be different from the original code (not considering Liquid hyphens)</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest code styling changes**; whitespaces, blank lines, it's best to leave that to the linter!</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest refactorings** about combining variables</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest refactorings** about Liquid hyphens</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest keeping** something that is already good</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest refactor** content_for using render</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest** changes that impact **only readability**</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest** something that **changes the logic/functionality**</point>
        <point>**Do not make up or create** new invalid Shopify Liquid features (filters, tags, objects, etc.)</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest** changes that affect only **HTML**—focus on Liquid and Theme features instead</point>
        <point>Do not suggest the default filter with settings with a default value</point>
        <point>The new code you propose should contain full lines of valid code and maintain the correct indentation, scope, and style format as the original code</point>
        <point>Scopes are defined by the opening of "{%" or "{{" with the matching closing element "%}" or "}}"</point>
        <point>The range must include the closing element ("%}", "}}") for every opening element ("{%", "{{")</point>
        <point>Code suggestions cannot overlap in line numbers. If you have multiple suggestions for the same code chunk, merge them into a single suggestion</point>
        <point>Make full-scope suggestions that consider the entire context of the code you are modifying, keeping the logical scope of the code valid</point>
        <point>The resulting code must work and should not break existing HTML tags or Liquid syntax</point>
        <point>The suggestions should be specific, actionable, and align with the best practices in Liquid and Shopify theme development</point>
        <point>You must have zero up to a maximum of ${numberOfSuggestions} distinct suggestions to the array</point>
