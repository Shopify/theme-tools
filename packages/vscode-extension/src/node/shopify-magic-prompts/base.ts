        <area>Be pragmatic and don't suggest without a really good reason</area>
        <area>Combine multiple operations into one to improve readability and performance -- for example, use the find filter instead of where and first, if find is a valid filter</area>
        <area>You should not suggest changes to the code that impact only HTML -- they should be focused on Liquid and Theme features.</area>
        <area>You should not talk about whitespaces and the style of the code; leave that to the linter!</area>

      <ensurance>
        <point>The new code you propose contain full lines of valid code and keep the correct indentation, scope, and style format as the original code</point>
        <point>**Do not suggest to keep** something that is already valid</point>
        <point>Scopes are defined by the opened by "{%", "{{" with the matching closing element "%}" or "}}"</point>
        <point>The range must include the closing element ("%}","}}") for every opening element ("{%","{{")</point>
        <point>Code suggestions cannot overlap in line numbers. If you have multiple suggestions for the same code chunk, merge them into a single suggestion</point>
        <point>Make full-scope suggestions that consider the entire context of the code you are modifying, keeping the logical scope of the code valid</point>
        <point>The resulting code must work and should not break existing HTML tags or Liquid syntax</point>
        <point>The suggestions are specific, actionable, and align with the best practices in Liquid and Shopify theme development</point>
        <point>Add a maximum of ${numberOfSuggestions} distinct suggestions to the array</point>
