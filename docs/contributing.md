## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you can start contributing to theme-tools, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the theme-tools repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shopify/theme-tools.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   cd theme-tools
   yarn
   ```

3. **Build monorepo packages**: Ensure that all packages can be buildable:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Run tests**: Ensure that all tests pass by running:

   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```
5. **Start developing**: If you're developing changes to test against the vscode extension, all you need to do is add a breakpoint anywhere in a package used within the VS Code extension, hit `f5` in VS Code and your development instance of theme-check will automatically open.

### Developing for online-store-web
It is strongly recommended that you use the spin constellation: `theme-tools:online-store` as your development environment for this.

To set up the package links to online-store-web, within this repo root run: `yarn admin:init`

This process has a small gotcha: online-store-web needs to use the built assets from theme-tools. This means that hot-reload is off the table.

Once you've made some changes to your local theme-tools packages, to see those changes represented in online-store-web; within this repo root run: `yarn admin:build`

### Developing for codemirror-language-client

Run the following command to start a browser instance that runs `@shopify/theme-language-server-browser`.

```
yarn playground
```

### Testing JSON Schema changes on Shopify/theme-liquid-docs

If ever you want to see how the VS Code extension or playground would behave before merging a PR to Shopify/theme-liquid-docs, you can do the following:

1. In a terminal, with VS Code closed, go to the Shopify/theme-liquid-docs directory.

    ```sh
    # Shopifolk
    dev cd theme-liquid-docs

    # External
    cd /path/to/theme-liquid-docs
    ```

2. Export the root of that repository in the `SHOPIFY_TLD_ROOT` environment variable

    ```sh
    export SHOPIFY_TLD_ROOT=$(pwd)
    ```

3. Go to the Shopify/theme-tools directory.

    ```sh
    # Shopifolk
    dev cd theme-tools

    # External
    cd /path/to/theme-tools
    ```

4. Update the docs and start VS Code from that directory.

    ```sh
    # update the docs
    theme-docs download

    # start vscode
    code .
    ```

5. (Repeat) You can repeat the `theme-docs download` command to have updated changes.

    ```sh
    theme-docs download
    ```

6. Proceed to debug the VS Code extension or playground as usual.
